	<h2>Catching Butterflies; Final Project</h2>
	<p> <font color=yellow> My inspiration for Catching Butterflies was nostalgic and childhood adventures. I made it my own by having the characters in the video have a little adventure on their way to catch some butterflies. The format I used was an animation short. My video is about a group of girls on a adventure together, they have to go through some woods to get to the place where they will find butterflies and try to catch them. Some media techniques I used were to make the color of the setting get lighter and colorful and make the girls walk through these settings to show passing of time and their journey leading down to the butterfly destination.</font> </p>
